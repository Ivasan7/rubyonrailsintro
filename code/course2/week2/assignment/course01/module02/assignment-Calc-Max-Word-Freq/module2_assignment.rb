#Implement a class called LineAnalyzer.
class LineAnalyzer

  #* line_number      - the line number analyzed (provided)

  #* initialize() - taking a line of text (content) and a line number
  #* calculate_word_frequency() - calculates result

  #* take in a line of text and line number
  #* initialize the content and line_number attributes
